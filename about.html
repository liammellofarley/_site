I'm not sure how well it renders on current PCs as I haven't edited the core CSS and JS in a long time. This was made primarily as a self-motivated learning exercise and was developed in the span of a few months with minimal prior experience in web development, so I apologize if it's rough around the edges. Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) was used to simplify the addition of new photos.</p><p><span class="tab"></span>Outside of photography I enjoy a diverse array of hobbies, I've built several electric guitars and worked on teaching myself various instruments over the years. I've been a life long snowboarder and enjoy hiking and swimming whenever I can get the chance to leave the city. I enjoy reading, usually historical non-fiction but I also have a soft spot for science fiction with Gibson and Atwood being some of my favorite authors.</p></div> </div> </div> <div id="navwrapper"> <div id="logo"> <h1>LIAM FARLEY</h1> </div> <nav> <ul id="navbar"> <li><a id="slideshow-nav" href="index.html">HOME</a></li> <li><a id="portfoliopage-nav" href="portfolio.html">PORTFOLIO</a></li> <li><a id="aboutpage-nav" class="active-nav fade-activepage" href="about.html">ABOUT</a></li> <li><a id="contactpage-nav" href="contact.html">CONTACT</a></li> </ul> </nav> </div> </div> </body> </html>
